# How it All Started

The date was April 8th, 2022. Ether is floating around $3300, and everything is calm in the daily. Suddenly, at 3:08:48 p.m. (UTC-4), the sky lights up: u/etheraider wishes everyone a good afternoon, then announces that “the EthFinance NFTs are ready for launch and are now minted on the blockchain!”

In a 700-word comment, he introduced the EVMavericks collection as a way to “recognize the EthFinance culture and give us an identity that we could share and have immortalized on chain”. We’re told that there will be 1324 NFTs in total, a tribute to legendary fallen brother EZPZ. With the help of u/Bad_Investment in scraping historical daily threads, a corps of EthFinance daily veterans was identified. The project quickly gets off the ground with, u/etheraider thanking u/Bad_Investment for his contribution, with prominent Ethfinancemod u/jtnichol publishing a YouTube video explaining the project shortly after.

The distribution is as follows: the first 1000 NFTs will be distributed among 1200 users chosen according to the karma obtained in the last year, and in the last three months, within the EthFinance community. Selected users submitted their Ethereum addresses to be added to a whitelist for the initial no-cost mint.

The minting process begins shortly after.

Everyone is happy and the daily is full of comments from users proud to be on the whitelist!

# So… it Begins

At 6:45 p.m. on the same day, a first megathread is created. Mod u/lawfultots writes: “I’m digging the eyepatch on mine but was really hoping for a cigar, RIP”. He minted the EVM #335 (remember this number).

The first sale of an EVMaverick takes place on OpenSea on April 11th. It was a purchase by breeezyyy.eth, who paid 1 ETH ($2979.52) for a crowned cyberpunk lion (#851). The dam broke soon after, and the volume exploded: as of April 22nd, there were over 325 EVMaverick transactions, for a combined volume (OpenSea/LooksRare) of 547 ETH.

# The Confrontation Starts

On April 9th at 7:12:03 a.m., u/decibels42 raised the royalty issue for the first time in a comment on the first megathread. “When sales inevitably happen, where are the royalties going for Mav sales? Bad and Raider should definitely recoup as much as they need to believe they are compensated for their work but at a 7.5% royalty, at some point can at least part of it go to Gitcoin or the Protocol Guild, etc?” Some users respond, and the consensus is that royalties should fund public goods.

As the days go by, the controversy grows, and prices skyrocket on the resale market.

u/Etheraider publishes another megathread, proposing a split of the royalties at 75% to a community treasury, and 25% to himself as the creator, with a 2 year cap. Public debate rages in the comment section of the megathread, and within the EthFinance daily, as the EVM price skyrockets, ratcheting up the stakes of any eventual resolution. EVMaverick#555 is a good example of the meteoric rise: it was bought for 1.5 ETH on April 16, then sold the very next day for… 5.55 ETH. The floor is soon near 3 ETH.

This unexpected popularity was about to cause a huge stir. As it turned out, a private drama was unfolding in DMs between Etheraider and the EthFinance mod team.

The mods of the EthFinance subreddit and u/etheraider disagreed on what would constitute a fair distribution of royalties. As EthFinance was born out of a split from EthTrader following the monetization of EthTrader via a token named “Donuts”, the issue struck a nerve in the community. Tensions rose until the mods asked u/etheraider not to post further about EVMs, then expanded that moratorium to all EVMs conversation, directing all EVM-related content to the EVMavericks Discord.

# The Drama

Things finally came to a head publicly on April 20th. This date, the activity of the daily exceeds the 2000-mark for the second day in a row, resembling swarm-intensity to a degree that is usually reserved for dailies akin to big market moves, or of significant Ethereum-related news. Safe to say that this adds an extra dimension to the work-environment for all actors in this story. Private negotiations between u/Etheraider and the mod team had reached a deadlock, with vastly different ideas of what would constitute reasonable compensation. The mods made it clear that 32 ETH - and no ongoing royalties - was the best they felt comfortable doing. u/etheraider subsequently went public to post a third megathread offering to accept his “worst critics” offer, a proposal of a cap at 187 ETH, without revealing the ongoing private conversation with the mods.

In response, mod u/lawfultots published a stickied comment in the daily to warn that the discussions surrounding the EVMavericks were now to be confined to the Discord server, writing: “The financial side of EVMs have generated strife in the community, and we would like to wash our hands of it rather than have another DONUTS incident.” Accusations of censorship abounded, and the atmosphere was one of fear as the EthFinance community seemed poised to tear itself apart.

r/EthFinance mod u/lawfultots clarified the mod position: “We made efforts to compromise with u/etheraider directly last night and could not find a comfortable middle ground. I would not get your hopes up.” Shortly thereafter, he burned his EVM (#335) in protest! The market lost confidence in the project, and the EVM floor price crashed to a floor of 0.3 ETH.

At this point, the EVMavericks saga had become a drama of epic proportions, leaving the EthFinance community starkly divided into two camps, as the debate raged on furiously in the Discord.

Amidst the height of this drama, a new aspect of the case was discovered. User jonas.eth shared an image that looked suspiciously similar to the EVMaverick base lion. As this predated the collection by 5 years at least, the similarities ignited instant controversy, with some holders raising ethical and legal concerns around the intellectual property in use in the project.

# The Resolution

Eventually, Discord mod @interweaver created a Snapshot proposal with 4 options to gauge the community’s sentiment. At the crux of the matter was the potential wedge driven between the fledgling EVM community and the EthFinance subreddit, and the 4 options were designated to weigh desirability of royalties against the importance of ties between the two communities. Option 3, “We should try hard to maintain our close association with EthFinance, as long as we can still monetize EVMs directly and exclusively in support of public goods, with the exception of Etheraider getting at most 32 Eth equivalent in compensation for his work”, ended up winning the vote, garnering 65% of the responses.

At the time, however, the vote sat open, as all day long on April 21st, u/etheraider continued to engage with the community of EVM holders on Discord. The exchanges alternated between discouragement, hope, and fatality, but the pressure was immense for the project’s creator. u/etheraider, under mounting pressure from the community, planned a week’s rest to digest all this–a mental health break to process everything. At the same time, however, the holders worried that without a quick resolution to the question of royalties, such a break would kill the project’s momentum, and that the issue should ideally be resolved quickly, and pushed for an immediate commitment from u/etheraider to hand over keys to the wallet governing the royalties.

Understandably upset by what he saw as attacks on his personal integrity, u/etheraider posted an announcement revealing that, in fact, the royalties derived from OpenSea trading of EVMs were being directed to his own second separate wallet address, to the tune of (at that time) an additional 12-13 ETH. In an effort to clear his name, u/etheraider explained that he could have taken this money and run, but was making the choice not to out of respect for the EVM community.

# In his own words at the time:

“If I was a scammer I would have obscured this fact and walked away and no one would have known that I had almost 32 already and I could have “pocketed” the extra 12-13 ETH. Would’ve gotten away with it scott free and no one would have been the wiser. But the fact is I’m not a scammer despite what many here have said. I hope this serves to show the gross way I have been misrepresented by some in the community and shows ultimately that I did this project for the betterment of this sub.”

At 2:37pm, u/etheraider proposed that he would take 100 Eth of the current and future royalties and walk away from the project.

“I’ll make this simple for everyone. honestly, and people can decide what they want on it. this is my final serious proposal as it seems that people just want me to walk away at this point. I will take 100 ETH and walk away forever and hand everything over to the community for the project to go in whatever direction desired.”

This was perhaps the nadir of the project. The proposal was met with a flurry of thumbs-down emojis and comments to the effect of “stick a fork in it, this project is done”, but also with further negotiation from the EVMs community, recognizing the very real possibility that if the EthFinance community did not wish to continue associating with the project, it would receive almost no further royalties and u/Etheraider’s hopes for 100 Eth would be impossible anyway. Royalties up to 32 Eth and no more, as proposed by the EthFinance mods several days earlier, and as voted for in a community Snapshot, was put forth as the only acceptable compromise.

At 2:41pm, u/etheraider conceded that he would accept the proposed 32 Eth offer (the equivalent of a validator), and would then hand over the keys to the contract to an emergency multisig composed of newly appointed Discord mods, before taking a step back from the project. This announcement was met with much jubilation by all. He did eventually return to the project after tensions had subsided – years in DAO time, but a few days on the calendar.

Legal concerns about the intellectual property for EVMavericks drama were also resolved when a member of the DAO, krism142, acquired rights to the original lion image on Shutterstock, purchasing a global commercial license which he plans to transfer over to the DAO.

Somebody even sent u/lawfultots a new EVMaverick (#1229)! A new pride had risen.
