To advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education.

# Vision

ManeNet DAO envisions a world with a long-term, self-sufficient, and regenerative cryptoeconomic landscape. We see an ecosystem with a greater symbiotic effect between its protocols and users; one that enables sustainable and reliable public goods funding for projects that need it most.

# Values

### Public goods

ManeNet DAO emerges from the culture of open-source software, the foundation of Web3. ManeNet DAO treasury allocates funding towards public goods that honor this ethos, through avenues such as Gitcoin. We want to set an example for future Web3 communities: contribute to the infrastructure that underpins this space while still providing value to your members.

### Education

The current technological landscape of Ethereum is a world of opportunities with increasingly complex innovation. ManeNet DAO will host and distribute knowledge so the community can remain on the cutting edge on this new and exciting frontier. The foundation of our community has always been education. We have a history of teaching each other, and we want to extend our tradition of discussion amongst intellectually honest peers to a wider audience.
Decentralization

We value decentralization in all aspects: of the network and of power. ManeNet DAO actively supports a distributed Ethereum and works to amplify its resilience, as well as incentivize decentralization in existing and future projects. We believe that decentralization is a means to provide freedom, fairness, and open access to every person.
